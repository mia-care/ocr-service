# OCR Overview
This is a simple OCR microservice written in Python using the [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi) framework and the [PyTesseract](https://github.com/madmaze/pytesseract) library, which is a wrapper for Google's [Tesseract OCR Engine](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract). It's a standalone plugin that doesn't require configuration.

## Limitations
Currently, this microservice only supports image files with the following MIME types:
- image/jpeg
- image/png

## Examples
To give an idea of how the microservice works, practical examples are given below.
